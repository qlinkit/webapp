    						if you put the info in a qlink and send the qlink through a normal email, 
    						then the recipient will be sure that nobody else read the info if he or she 
    						did read it after clicking on the qlink.</p>

        					clicked until its recipient gets it!</p>',

    'how_secure'		=> '<p>The text message you type in qlink.it is never written on a hard disk.  
    						The text message is scrambled, codified, encrypted, and It is kept as 
    						random access memory until the recipient clicks the qlink. Since the key 
    						to decodify the message is encrypted in the qlink, the absolute only 
    						way to read the message is by placing an external request to the server 
    						using the qlink.  After the message is accessed through the qlink, the 
    						server performs a secure delete on the message.  At this point, the 
    						message only remains at the screen of the recipient and it has been 
    						securely deleted everywhere else.</p>

	    					<p>We do not keep track of any info related nor to the text message, nor to 
	    					the sender or recipient\'s time or IP.  Only upon a sender\'s request we 
	    					could imprint in the message an authenticity signature or a PIN to 
	    					yield a more secure communication in a future version.</p>

	    					<p>In a next soon version, there will be a couple of servers running 
	    					in alternation in such a way that every 48 hours each server is totally 
	    					destroyed by re-installing a new and empty image of the server on itself.</p>

	    					<p>We take security extremely seriously, since this is our main product.  
	    					We must assure that the info sent by qlink.it is never seen by anybody 
	    					but the sender and the recipient.  These features, in addition to other technical 
	    					ones, make the big difference between qlink.it and other similar existing ideas.</p>',

							thing that remains in the corresponding in- and out-boxes is a dead qlink. 
							This is very important, because if any email account is eventually hacked, 
							the hacker will not be able to read the text that was sent by qlink.it.</p>

							 The qlink is a purely classical object, as well as the server that runs it.  
							 The inspiration comes from the fact that in quantum mechanics the wave function 
							 of a particle collapses when it is measured, and this is one of the key 
							 ingredients to quantum cryptography.  In analogy, the qlink disappears once it is read. 
							 In this way, the server that runs qlink.it would make an analogous -but not the same- 
							 role of Nature in collapsing the wave-function, and this is why the maximum 
							 level of security is reached when the running server is under physical control.</p>',

							Hence, one has to be quite cautious when handling qlinks, either when one is 
							sending a qlink, or when one is receiving a qlink.</p>

							<p>The qlink expires. Therefore, the recipient should open it before its 
							expiration time, which is warned at the time of generating the qlink.</p>',
